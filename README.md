# ImageTool
Plug-in for Netbeans for editing images, with background erase

This is a simple pixel editor which plugs into Netbeans.  It has the useful "magic erase" feature, where 
you give it a background and foreground color, and the pixel will be made transparent if it is near the 
background color. 

A pre-compiled version is available at https://jfaden.net/~jbf/netbeans/com-cottagesystems-imagetool.nbm .
